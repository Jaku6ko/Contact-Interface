This is an interface made with HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap) and JS (with Jquery) that is used to access the contact database. It consists of:
-A UI that lets the user generate a new contact in the database (using the Contact API) 
-A table that shows recently added contacts with options to delete or update them.
-A search bar that lets the user find given contact by its ID.
-A list button, that lists the 5 latest contacts added to the database.
